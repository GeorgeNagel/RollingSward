## Scenario Rules:

### Skirmish at Amon Sul (Weathertop)
3018, 6 October, evening

Friendly characters:
Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin

Enemy characters:
Murazor, Khamûl, Dwar, Ji Indur, Akhorahil

Special rules:

* Hobbits are objectives for wraiths
* Torch is objective for Aragorn to pick up
* On attacking a wraith while carrying the torch, the wraith routes
* When three wraiths have routed, all wraiths route.

AI:

* All wraiths prioritize moving into melee with an unengaged hobbit
and will ignore Aragorn.
* On a successful wound of a hobbit, the hobbit is knocked down. At the beginning of an
activation, a wraith may pick up the felled hobbit and begin moving towards the nearest
table edge.
* If the ring bearer is felled, he is also stabbed, taking a -1 Defense for the remainder of the game.

Table:
Weathertop consists of a 6"x6" courtyard with ruined walls.
Each wall has several arched openings. The courtyard sits atop a hill with
stairs or a ramp leading both from the west side and east side of the courtyard.
At the start of the battle, the hobbits are in the courtyard, the wraiths start 10" from
east of the courtyard and Aragorn starts on the west table edge.

### Rivendell (healing)
Any units who had wound points from the Skirmish at Weathertop heal all wound slots.

### Wargs Near The Misty Mountains
3019, 13 January, morning

Friendly characters:
All living members of The Fellowship

Enemy characters:
Wargs

Special rules:
* If all three of the alpha wargs are killed, all of the wargs will route.
* None of the wargs will route until all three alphas are killed.
* If Gandalf picks up the torch, all unengaged wargs will keep 2" away from him.
If an unengaged warg is closer than 2" to Gandalf when he is carrying the torch,
they will use at least half of their movement activation to move
at least 2" away from Gandalf before doing anything else.

Table:
In the center of the table is a stone circle atop a hill, 10" in diameter.
Inside the circle is a crop of 3-4 trees.
There is a fire just south of the tree cluster.
On the fire is a torch that Gandalf may pick up.
The Fellowship deploys around the fire at minimum 1" away from other characters.
Gandalf must deploy on the other side of the trees from the torch.
The wargs deploy even-spaced outside the stone circle.

### Watcher of Moria
3019, 13 January, evening

Friendly characters:
All living members of The Fellowship

Enemy characters:
The Watcher In The Water

Table:
In the center of the board is a 8" diameter pool.
4" to the east of the pool is the gate to Moria.
In the center of the pool is the Watcher, represented by 21 tentacles.
The Fellowship deploy between the pool and the gate.

Special rules:
* Each tentacle has a range of 4" _outside_ the pool.
* Each tentacle may move any distance as long as it stays
    within 4" _outside_ the pool.
* Each tentacle gets its own activation.
* On a successful attack, the tentacle picks up the defendant.
* If picked up, the defendant can no longer attack until dropped.
* If a tentacle carrying a character is felled, it drops the character it is carrying.
* A Fellowship character can move half their normal move distance if they are in the pool.
* If a carried character is inside the pool for a full turn they are drowned.
* Play ends when every Fellowship character is felled or inside the gates to Moria.

AI:
* If carrying characters, move the character closest to the pool into the center
    of the pool.
* The unactivated tentacle closet to an enemy will activate.
* If a tentacle starts its turn carrying someone, it will move them inside the
    pool to "drown" them.
* If a character is drowned, the tentacle is free to attack another character.
* The Watcher may only carry three characters at a time.
* Once 10 tentacles have been felled, all tentacles not carrying someone will
    "retreat" underwater and leave the board.
