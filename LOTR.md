## Scenario Rules:

### Skirmish at Amon Sul (Weathertop)
3018, 6 October, evening

Friendly characters:
Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin

Enemy characters:
Murazor, Khamûl, Dwar, Ji Indur, Akhorahil

Special rules:

* Hobbits are objectives for wraiths
* Torch is objective for Aragorn to pick up
* On attacking a wraith while carrying the torch, the wraith routes
* When three wraiths have routed, all wraiths route.

AI:

* All wraiths prioritize moving into melee with an unengaged hobbit
and will ignore Aragorn.
* On a successful wound of a hobbit, the hobbit is knocked down. At the beginning of an
activation, a wraith may pick up the felled hobbit and begin moving towards the nearest
table edge.

Table:
Weathertop consists of a 6"x6" courtyard with ruined walls.
Each wall has several arched openings. The courtyard sits atop a hill with
stairs or a ramp leading both from the west side and east side of the courtyard.
At the start of the battle, the hobbits are in the courtyard, the wraiths start 10" from
east of the courtyard and Aragorn starts on the west table edge.

### Rivendell (healing)
Any units who had wound points from the Skirmish at Weathertop heal all wound slots.

### Wargs Near The Misty Mountains
3019, 13 January, morning

Friendly characters:
All living members of The Fellowship

Enemy characters:
Wargs

Special rules:
* Wargs may make three pivot-move sequences of 2" moves. 
If they fell an enemy, they can only follow with a single 2" move activation.
* If all three of the alpha wargs are killed, all of the wargs will route.
* If Gandalf picks up the torch, all unengaged wargs will keep 4" away from him.
If an unengaged warg is closer than 4" to Gandalf when he is carrying the torch,
they will use their activation to move at least 4" away from Gandalf before doing anything else.

Table:
In the center of the table is a stone circle atop a hill, 10" in diameter.
Inside the circle is a crop of 3-4 trees.
There is a fire just south of the tree cluster.
On the fire is a torch that Gandalf may pick up.
The Fellowship deploys around the fire.
