# Solo Narrative Minis Ruleset

## What
This ruleset is designed to provide fast-paced play with a handful
of miniatures, with battles lasting about 15-30 minutes. It can be played
solo or cooperatively. Each battle happens in a narrative framework where
each battle has a long-lasting impact.

## Why
There is a comparative lack of rulesets for solo miniatures wargaming.
Existing rulesets for miniatures games are lengthy, individual games
take over an hour to complete, and they favor special case rulesets
for each faction. This special casing seems intended to sell as many
boxes of plastic as possible, and part of the fun is in deeply knowing
all of the special rules for your faction. I personally don't find this aspect
of miniatures games to be fun.
This ruleset is intended to create acrade-like fast gameplay with a
narrative framework that gives a long-lasting impact to each battle.

## Rules

### Narrative Layer

The narrative layer guides what scenarios occur and gives a larger
context to individual battles.

#### Major scenes
1. Bree - sneak away from hunting wraiths
1. Bree bridge - escape wraiths

### Battle Layer

The narrative layer determines which companies collide and from which
sides of the board.
Cards are created for each mini on the game board with their name, an
attack modifier, a defense modifier, and a shooting range if available.
One side is controlled by AI and the other by the player. The game takes
place over a series of rounds until either the player or the AI is routed
from the board or all units are wounded to the ground. After the game, any
wounds the player's characters sustained are resolved and play moves back to
the narrative layer.

Play proceeds as follows.

"General" means either the player commanding friendly units or the AI
commanding enemy units.

#### Round

1. All terrain and units are placed on the board per the narrative layer.
1. Any starting wounds on units are marked on the corresponding
characters' cards.
1. The human general rolls a D6 to determine who starts the round. On a 1-3,
the AI general starts, and on a 4-6 the human general starts.
1. The generals take turns activating units. If the general has no more
characters to activate or wishes to pass, the other general can continue
activating units.
1. The round continues until all units have been activated or both generals
wish to pass.


#### Activation

During an activation, a character may

1. If in base-to-base contact with an enemy character, the character must
continue melee contact until one of the characters falls from wounds or routes.
1. If a character is routing, they must move the maximum distance towards the
closest table edge.
1. Before a move, a character may pick up a target.
1. Move up to 3", pivot, and move up to 3", or move 6" in a single direction.
If the character moves into base contact with another character, they can
melee attack. If a character fells an enemy during melee, they can follow up
with up to 3" of movement.
1. Move up to 3" and shoot with a -1 attack modifier.
1. Stand and shoot with no modifier.

Attacking consists of rolling on D6, adding the attacking character's attack
modifier, and subtracting the defender's defence modifier. If the resulting
value is greater than 3, it is a wound. A roll of 1 is always a miss and a
roll of 6 is always a wound. If the wounded character has no wound slots, they
are removed from play as "fallen". Otherwise, add a wound token to the
available wound slot.

If a character is removed from play and their company has lost over 50% of its
units, the company must make a route check. Roll a D6, and on a roll of 3 or
less, the company routes.

### AI
The basic AI is as follows.

1. Route towards nearest table edge if company is routing
1. If carrying an objective, move towards the nearest table edge.
1. If standing near a target, pick it up.
1. Continue melee if in melee. If multiple bases are in contact, use
a D6 to determine which enemy to attack.
1. If in shooting range of a shootable enemy, stand and shoot. If multiple
enemies can be shot at, shoot at the closest one.
1. If character can move into shooting range of shootable enemy,
move and shoot, always choosing the closest target.
1. If there is a visible target in movement range, move towards it and
pick it up.
1. If there are unengaged enemies in movement range, move towards the closest
one and engage in melee. If an enemy is felled, follow it up with a 3" move.
1. If a target is viewable, move towards the nearest target
1. If an enemy is viewable, move towards the nearest enemy

1. If routing, route towards the nearest table edge.
1. If engaged in melee, resolve melee.
1. If next to a fallen target, pick it up.
1. If carrying a target, move towards the nearest table edge.
1. If in shooting range, stand and shoot at closest target.
1. If can move into shooting range, move and shoot and closest target.
1. If target can be engaged, engage target. If it can be picked up, pick it up.


### Cooperative play
For cooperative play, human generals each manage one or more friendly characters.
The human generals switch off activating during the human turn. I.e. Human 1
activates Unit H1, AI activates Unit A1, Human 2 activates Unit H2, AI
activates Unit A2, and so on.
