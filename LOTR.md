AI:

* All wraiths prioritize moving into melee with an unengaged hobbit
and will ignore Aragorn.

table edge.
* If the ring bearer is felled, he is also stabbed, taking a -1 Defense for the remainder of the game.

Weathertop consists of a 6"x6" courtyard with ruined walls.
Each wall has several arched openings. The courtyard sits atop a hill with
stairs or a ramp leading both from the west side and east side of the courtyard.
At the start of the battle, the hobbits are in the courtyard, the wraiths start 10" from
east of the courtyard and Aragorn starts on the west table edge.
